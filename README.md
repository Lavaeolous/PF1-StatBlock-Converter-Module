# Change of Ownership
I no longer have time to maintain this module, but luckily someone stepped in. New versions of the module will be released here:
The change in ownership should be reflected in the FoundryVTT Package Manager as well, and new versions should be downloadable as is without reinstalling.

```
Please report any issues in that git going forward.

This git will be kept open as an archive, but will no longer receive updates.
